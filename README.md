# Automating-the-Identification-of-Dolphins-and-Whales

Happywhale has sponsored a Kaggle competition for a machine learning model that will take images and identify whales and dolphins to assist in marine life research. Datasets containing test and training images, as well as a training.csv file containing the species and IDs of the training images, have been provided. To determine which model would be best, research studies and a previous competition on topics similar to this project were analyzed, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was chosen. The training dataset was explored to determine how the training data was distributed across the various classes and species of marine mammals. Image augmentation was applied during pre-processing to combat dataset inequalities, with the goal of limiting overfitting in the model. A single level CNN was developed with limitations from computing resources limiting the architecture. A validation set was made from the training set, and the model was trained. Hyperparameter tuning was performed. The modelsâ€™ predictions were submitted to Kaggle, and a MAP@5 score was returned.
